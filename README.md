# Fric-Frog Memory Game 🐸

Fric-Frog is a browser-based memory game built with **React, Vite, and TypeScript**.  
Originally developed as a learning project to deepen my understanding of modern React patterns, it quickly evolved into a polished and enjoyable interactive experience.

The game challenges players to test their memory by selecting unique cards without repeating previous choices. As the score increases, so does the difficulty.
